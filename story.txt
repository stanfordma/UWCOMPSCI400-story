I come from Taiwan and my major is computer science. I am currently studying at Uw-Madison as a transfer student. 
I had studied at community college in Washington State for two years. My hobby includs playing video game, watching movies and hanging out with my friends. This semester, I am taking CMMPSCI400 and this is my first time to create GitHub. 

I am a second year student from Washington DC and I am studying electrical engineering. 
I enjoy playing ice hockey, playing the guitar, and cooking.

I am Junior student who study at Computer Science.
I like watching movies, swimming and running.

Last week, I met a girl called Dacy and she was really beautiful. I fell in love with her at the first glance.
We had a really nice chat, and I invited her to watch a movie together this weekend. She said yes and I felt really happy about it.

However, on the day of the date, the gril wasn't there and I can't reach her by 
any means. I found out that she stood me up, and I was so sad that I made myself
a promise that I wouold never chase a girl again.
